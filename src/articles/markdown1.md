# Hello World

This first post actually made on the amidst verge on the urge of writing some writing platform for daily coding diary. But never been finished anyway because I couldn't get rid of my perfectionist side as I build the front-end design with some basic HTML and CSS

## got trapped in the whirldwind of thoughts

Is pretty crazy to think about the process of making something without any limiter. It's gaining complexity as I move to more finished product.
At first, I just want a basic classic old time generic blog, but the thing is, I just couldn't resist to upscale the process by adding another element which the mechanism itself seems new and vague. But I throw into my code **ANYWAY!**.

## it ain't easy to getting smacked on the face

After all, I just focus in the thing that wasn't my purpose at the first place. on the time I do whatever I did at that time, The train of guilty thoughts are gaining momentun. And then the moment I realized... _"tf am I doing!"_ I just felt something smacked my face.

## **_ANOTHER UNABLE TO CONCENTRATE FEELING_**

Everyone just gathered around me and break my concentration. let me get it finished by tomorrow.
